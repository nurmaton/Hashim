        "1.  **Dynamic vs. Kinematic:** The particle's motion is no longer prescribed by a mathematical function. Instead, it is *dynamically calculated* at each time step based on physical forces (internal elasticity, fluid pressure, viscosity, etc.).\n",
        "2.  **Deformable Physics:** The particle is modeled as an elastic body with mass, stiffness, and surface tension, allowing it to deform in response to fluid forces. This is based on the penalty Immersed Boundary Method from Sustiel & Grier.\n",
        "3.  **Stateful Simulation:** The core data structures have been rewritten to be *stateful*, holding the current positions and velocities of the particle markers. The entire simulation state is a JAX PyTree that is evolved over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we move beyond standard \"forward\" simulation to demonstrate the core power of a **differentiable physics engine**. Instead of just predicting what will happen, we will ask the computer to determine the physical parameters required to achieve a specific goal. This is known as an **inverse problem**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Goal: Automated Physical Design\n",
        "\n",
        "Our specific inverse problem is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **\"Given a target final shape for our droplet, what initial `stiffness` value is required to produce that exact shape after the simulation runs?\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "We will solve this using the **gradient descent** algorithm, the same fundamental technique that powers much of modern machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Process\n",
        "\n",
        "The code below implements a complete optimization pipeline in three main stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define a Loss Function (`simulate_and_get_loss`):**\n",
        "    We create a master Python function that encapsulates the entire simulation. This function takes a single input—a guess for the `stiffness`—and returns a single output: a numerical \"error\" or \"loss.\" The loss is calculated as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the final shape produced by the simulation and our desired target shape. The smaller the loss, the closer we are to our goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Automatic Differentiation (`jax.grad`):**\n",
        "    This is the key step where JAX works its magic. We use `jax.grad()` to automatically create a new function that can compute the gradient of our entire loss function. This gradient is a single number that tells us the \"slope\" of the loss with respect to the stiffness. It gives us a precise recipe: \"to reduce the error, you should change the stiffness in this specific direction.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **The Optimization Loop:**\n",
        "    We write a simple `for` loop that repeatedly performs the gradient descent update. In each iteration, it:\n",
        "    *   Calculates the gradient for the current `stiffness` guess. This is the most computationally expensive step, as it requires running the simulation forward and backward.\n",
        "    *   Updates the `stiffness` by taking a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
        "    *   Logs the progress, allowing us to see the `stiffness` and `loss` values converge over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we visualize the results to confirm that the optimizer successfully \"walked\" from our initial bad guess to the true stiffness value, driven purely by the gradients of the physics simulation."
