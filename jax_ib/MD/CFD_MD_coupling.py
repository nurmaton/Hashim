Functions for coupling CFD (fluid) and MD (particle) simulations.

This module provides the necessary tools to transfer information from the
Eulerian fluid grid to the Lagrangian MD particles. The primary mechanism for
this is interpolation, which allows us to find the fluid velocity at the precise
location of each particle. This fluid velocity can then be used to apply a
drag force or other hydrodynamic interaction to the particles in the MD simulation.

    Interpolates a field at a set of fractional coordinates using JAX's `map_coordinates`.

    This is a low-level wrapper around JAX's N-dimensional spline interpolation
    function. It takes a field (as a raw array) and a list of coordinate arrays
    and returns the interpolated values.

    Args:
      field: The N-dimensional JAX array of data to interpolate from.
      surface_coord: A list of coordinate arrays. For a 2D field, this would be
        `[x_coords, y_coords]`, where `x_coords` and `y_coords` are arrays of
        the target locations in fractional grid index units.

    Interpolates a `GridVariable` field to a list of physical particle positions.

    This function serves as the main bridge from the Eulerian grid to the
    Lagrangian particles. It takes a `GridVariable` (which contains the fluid data
    and all the necessary grid metadata) and a list of physical particle positions,
    and returns the value of the field at each particle's location.

    It assumes periodic boundary conditions, which are handled by the underlying
    `map_coordinates` function (implicitly, via its default `mode`).

    Args:
      field: The `GridVariable` representing the fluid field (e.g., a velocity component).
      list_p: A JAX array of shape `(N, D)` where `N` is the number of particles
        and `D` is the number of dimensions, containing the physical coordinates
        of each particle.

    Calculates the hydrodynamic force on MD particles from the fluid velocity.

    This function represents the coupling from the CFD solver to the MD solver.
    It interpolates the fluid velocity to each particle's position and returns
    this as a "force" (or more accurately, a velocity that can be used to
    calculate a Stokes drag force, F = Î³ * (u_fluid - v_particle)).

    The name is slightly misleading; it doesn't calculate the final force but
    provides the fluid velocity needed to do so in the MD code.

        both the CFD (`.velocity`) and MD (`.MD_var.position`) states.
