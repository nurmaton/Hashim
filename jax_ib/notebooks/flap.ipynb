        "**Key Differences from the Original Rigid Body Model:**\n",
        "1.  **Dynamic vs. Kinematic:** The particle's motion is no longer prescribed by a mathematical function. Instead, it is *dynamically calculated* at each time step based on physical forces (internal elasticity, fluid pressure, viscosity, etc.).\n",
        "2.  **Deformable Physics:** The particle is modeled as an elastic body with mass, stiffness, and surface tension, allowing it to deform in response to fluid forces. This is based on the penalty Immersed Boundary Method from Sustiel & Grier.\n",
        "3.  **Stateful Simulation:** The core data structures have been rewritten to be *stateful*, holding the current positions and velocities of the particle markers. The entire simulation state is a JAX PyTree that is evolved over time.\n",
