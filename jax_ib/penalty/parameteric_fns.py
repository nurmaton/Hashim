This module provides a collection of differentiable, parametric functions for
defining 2D shapes in polar coordinates.

These functions are fundamental to the project's shape optimization capabilities.
They are used to generate the target positions of the Lagrangian boundary markers
that define the immersed object's geometry.

Each function takes a `geometry_param` argument, which is a JAX array
containing the shape's defining parameters (e.g., radii, number of lobes).
Because these parameters are JAX arrays, the entire shape definition is
differentiable. This allows the main solver to compute gradients of a loss
function (e.g., drag) with respect to these geometric parameters, enabling
the automatic optimization of the object's shape for a desired outcome.
